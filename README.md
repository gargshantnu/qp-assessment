docker-compose up --build


## General Improvements

- Environment Variables: Use environment variables for sensitive information like JWT secret keys and database credentials. This can be done using packages like dotenv. Storing sensitive information in code is a security risk.

- Error Handling: Implement a centralized error handling middleware. This allows for a more manageable and consistent error handling strategy across your application.

- Logging: Consider using a more robust logging library like winston or morgan for better logging management, especially in production environments.

- Code Duplication: Reduce duplication in your validators (e.g., validateAddGroceryItem and validateUpdateGroceryItem have similar checks). You can create common validation functions and reuse them.

- Asynchronous Operations: Ensure all asynchronous operations are properly handled with try-catch or .catch() to prevent unhandled promise rejections.

## Specific File Improvements
- checkPermission.js:

Consider adding more detailed error messages or logging for denied permissions.

- auth.js:

Move 'my_secret_key' to an environment variable for security.
Provide more specific error messages for different types of JWT errors (e.g., token expired, token invalid).

- groceryItemValidator.js:

You have a placeholder for validateBookGroceries but no implementation. Ensure that this validation is completed and robust.
server.js:

The commented-out middleware usage for /admin and /user routes might indicate incomplete implementation or testing code. Ensure these are finalized or removed for clarity.


- GroceryController.js:

Consolidate repeated error handling logic into a function or middleware for DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.

- groceryRoutes.js:

There seems to be a typo in router.delete and router.put where adminController is used instead of groceryController.

- sequelize.js:

Consider adding sequelize configurations (like pool settings) and handling for reconnecting in case of database disconnection.


## Security Considerations

- JWT Secret Key: Ensure the JWT secret key is complex and stored securely.
- Database Password: Use strong passwords and avoid hardcoding them in your application code.
- Input Validation: Ensure robust validation to prevent SQL injection, especially in dynamic queries.
- Password Storage: Use bcrypt for hashing passwords before storing them in the database.


## Testing

- Implement unit tests and integration tests to cover your codebase, ensuring functionality and helping to prevent future regressions.

## Documentation

- Add comments and documentation for complex logic to improve readability and maintainability.
